# Appendix D — Codegen Target Catalog

This appendix enumerates the code-generation targets defined by CADL v0.3
and the mapping to the reference implementation's directory layout.
[Appendix A §A.9](./appendix-a-syntax.md#a9-codegen-block) defines the
EBNF for `codegen:` entries; this appendix
pairs each target name with its **category**, **intended artifact**, and
**implementation location** in the reference implementation
([`cadl`](https://github.com/ertlnagoya/cadl) 0.3).

## D.1 Target catalog

| Target name | Category | Emitted artifact | Reference-impl module | Command |
|-------------|----------|------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| `python` | Runtime code | Python package (actors, contract monitors, protocols, regime controller, metrics, runtime; for a file that declares `norms: 0.1`, also a monitor of the norms of [Appendix F](./appendix-f-norms.md)) | `cadl.codegen` | `cadl codegen -t python` |
| `solidity` | Institutional contract | Solidity [[Solidity Documentation]](./appendix-b-references.md) smart contracts, one per contract | `cadl.codegen.solidity` | `cadl codegen -t solidity` |
| `opa` | Institutional policy | Rego / OPA [[Open Policy Agent]](./appendix-b-references.md) policies, one per contract | `cadl.codegen.opa` | `cadl codegen -t opa` |
| `unity-csharp` | Runtime code | Unity C# classes for the lifecycles and monitors of [Appendix E](./appendix-e-sos-dsl.md) | `cadl.codegen.unity_csharp` | `cadl codegen -t unity-csharp` |
| `unity` | Simulator config | JSON for a Unity-based simulator | `cadl.sim.gen_unity` | `cadl sim-gen -t unity` |
| `go` | Simulator config | JSON for a Go-based simulator | `cadl.sim.gen_go` | `cadl sim-gen -t go` |
| `python` (simulator) | Simulator config | YAML for a Python-based simulator | `cadl.sim.gen_python` | `cadl sim-gen -t python` |
| `agent-rego` | Boundary policy | Rego policy that returns the allow / deny / escalate decision of [Appendix G](./appendix-g-agents.md) for a message | `cadl.codegen` | `cadl codegen -t agent-rego` |
| `agent-cedar` | Boundary policy | Cedar policies and a side table for the statically decidable part of [Appendix G](./appendix-g-agents.md) | `cadl.codegen` | `cadl codegen -t agent-cedar` |
| `ros2` | Runtime node | ROS 2 [[Macenski+, 2022]](./appendix-b-references.md) node scaffolds | not implemented in `cadl` 0.3 | — |
| other name (user-defined) | Plugin | Whatever the user plugin emits | no plugin mechanism exists in `cadl` 0.3; other target names are rejected on the command line and get a warning in a `codegen:` entry | — |

The name `python` denotes the runtime-code target in a `codegen:` entry;
the simulator configuration of the same name is requested with
`cadl sim-gen`. The Python simulator config therefore cannot be
requested from a `codegen:` entry in v0.3; use `cadl sim-gen -t python`.
In the reference implementation (`cadl` 0.3) the target is
selected on the command line as shown in the last column; `codegen:`
entries in the file are parsed but do not yet drive generation. From
`cadl` 0.3.9, an entry that names a target the implementation cannot
emit gets a warning (D.4).

For a file that declares the norms extension
([Appendix F](./appendix-f-norms.md)), the `python` target also emits
the module `norms_monitor.py` (in the development version after `cadl`
0.3.21). It monitors the `norms:` and `counts_as:` blocks and the
`assume:` and `guarantee:` items of each contract, including the items
with temporal operators, for one contract instance while the system
runs: it is given one observation at a time and returns the norm
instances and items whose state or verdict (`pending`, `fulfilled`,
`violated`, `excused`) changed. Unlike the other modules of the package,
it does not import `cadl`: it carries the contracts as data and the
evaluation code of `cadl norms-eval`, and uses only the standard library
of Python.
[F.10](./appendix-f-norms.md#f10-reference-implementation-status) gives
the details. The `solidity`, `opa`, and `unity-csharp` targets do not
monitor norms; `solidity` and `opa` leave the items with temporal
operators out of the generated checks, with a comment and a warning.

## D.2 Two-tier generator layout

The reference implementation splits codegen into two tiers, reflecting
whether the output is **code that enforces or executes the contracts**
or a **configuration for a simulator**:

```
src/cadl/
├── codegen/            ← code tier (cadl codegen)
│   ├── *_gen.py        ← Python runtime package
│   ├── solidity/       ← smart-contract enforcement of contracts
│   ├── opa/            ← policy enforcement (Rego) of contracts
│   └── unity_csharp/   ← Unity C# lifecycle / monitor runtime
└── sim/                ← simulator tier (cadl sim-gen)
    ├── ir.py           ← three-layer simulator IR
    ├── gen_unity.py
    ├── gen_go.py
    └── gen_python.py
```

A single CADL source file MAY declare targets from both tiers in one
`codegen:` block. The processor SHOULD dispatch each target to its tier
independently.

## D.3 Selection guidance

- Pick **`unity`** when the experiment is a multi-agent simulation with
  graphical inspection, and **`unity-csharp`** when contract lifecycles
  and monitors ([Appendix E](./appendix-e-sos-dsl.md)) are to run inside
  that simulation.
- Pick **`python`** when you want an executable runtime skeleton of the
  actors, contract monitors, and protocols, or when the norms of
  [Appendix F](./appendix-f-norms.md) are to be monitored while the
  system runs; **`ros2`** is reserved for
  driving actual robots and is not implemented in `cadl` 0.3.
- Pick **`solidity`** when the Institution-layer contracts must be
  enforced on-chain (blockchain deployment).
- Pick **`opa`** when contracts should be enforced as policies at API
  / service boundaries (policy-as-code).

Multiple targets in one file are permitted but the resulting
artifacts are independent — the CADL toolchain does not guarantee
runtime interoperability between, e.g., a Unity simulator config and a
Solidity contract generated from the same source.

## D.4 Conformance

A processor is **codegen-core-conforming** if it supports at least one
target from each tier (for example `unity` together with `solidity` or
`opa`).

A processor that cannot emit a requested target MUST report a clear
diagnostic (for example, "codegen target `ros2` is not supported by
this processor") rather than silently skipping it.
